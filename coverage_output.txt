## Coverage Progress Report - Final Push Session

**Target:** >80% test coverage
**Current Local Coverage:** 77.95%
**Progress:** Close to target, within 2.05% 

### Coverage Breakdown by Category:
- **Overall:** 77.95% (target: 80%+)
- **Components:** 92.79% (excellent)
- **Services:** 84.00% (excellent) 
- **Utils:** 100% (perfect)
- **App.tsx:** 32.23% (low, but complex integration)

### Key Achievements This Session:
1. **githubService.ts:** Improved from 71.71% with targeted error handling tests
2. **Strategic Tests:** Added final push tests for uncovered lines
3. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Created tests for delete operations, file history, project folders

### Files with Strategic Coverage Added:
- `src/services/__tests__/githubService.final.test.ts` - Targets lines 389-392, 400-401, 414-417, 435-437
- `src/components/__tests__/MarkdownViewer.strategy.test.tsx` - Targets markdown rendering edge cases

### Remaining Gaps:
- **App.tsx:** Complex integration file with low coverage (32.23%)
- **MarkdownViewer:** Some rendering edge cases (74.63%)
- **GitHistory:** Some conditional branches (96.8%)

### CI Environment Note:
Coverage may vary between local and CI environments due to:
- Node.js version differences (CI tests 20.x and 22.x)
- Test execution order variations
- Environment-specific code paths
- Different timing or async behavior

### Next Steps for 80%+ Achievement:
1. Investigate CI-specific coverage differences
2. Consider App.tsx integration test improvements
3. Fine-tune remaining service edge cases
4. Monitor CI pipeline for accurate coverage reporting

**Status:** Strong progress made, very close to 80% target. CI validation needed for final assessment.
