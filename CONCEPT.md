# Agentic Markdown Todos: Concept & Architecture

## 1. Vision & Core Concept

**Agentic Markdown Todos** is a sovereign task management application designed for developers, project managers, and anyone who values true data ownership. It transforms your personal Git repository into a powerful, AI-enhanced task management system while ensuring you maintain complete control over your data.

The core vision is to merge the simplicity and sovereignty of plain text files with the power of modern AI. Instead of being locked into a proprietary platform where your data can be held hostage, your tasks live in a format you already own and understand—markdown files in your own Git repository. You have the freedom to choose between GitHub and GitLab, use any self-hosted instance, and switch providers without losing any data.

### Key Principles:

*   **Sovereign Data Ownership:** Your tasks are `.md` files in your own Git repository. You can clone, edit, migrate, and manage them with any tool you choose—forever.
*   **Provider Freedom:** Choose between GitHub, GitLab.com, or any self-hosted GitLab instance. Your data remains portable across all Git providers.
*   **Git-Powered Workflow:** Every change, from creating a task to checking off an item, is a versioned commit. This provides a complete, auditable history of your progress with full Git benefits.
*   **AI as a Partner:** The app integrates an AI agent to act as a strategic partner. It helps with planning, decomposition of tasks, and administrative work like writing commit messages.
*   **Markdown-Native:** The primary interface for interacting with tasks is rich markdown, providing flexibility for notes, code snippets, and structured lists.
*   **Self-Sovereign Infrastructure:** Deploy on your own infrastructure with full control over data, AI providers, and hosting.

## 2. Core Features

*   **AI-Powered Task Generation:** Users provide a high-level goal (e.g., "Launch a new marketing website"). The AI agent analyzes the goal and generates a detailed, actionable checklist in markdown format.
*   **Multi-Provider Git Backend:** The application supports both GitHub and GitLab (including self-hosted instances) via Personal Access Tokens (PATs). All todos are stored as individual markdown files in a configurable directory within your chosen repository.
*   **Provider-Agnostic Design:** Seamlessly switch between GitHub and GitLab without losing any data. Your markdown files remain unchanged regardless of the Git provider.
*   **Conventional Commits:** The AI automatically generates descriptive [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) messages for every action (create, update, archive, delete), ensuring the repository's Git history is clean, semantic, and easy to follow.
*   **Interactive Markdown Editor:** Users can toggle between view and edit modes with a sophisticated markdown editor featuring:
    *   **Edit/View Toggle:** Switch seamlessly between rendered markdown preview and raw text editing
    *   **Save Progress Tracking:** Visual progress bars showing 6-step save process with real-time feedback
    *   **Unsaved Changes Protection:** Clear indicators and confirmation dialogs prevent accidental data loss
    *   **Full-Featured Editor:** Monospace font, proper indentation, and resize capabilities for comfortable editing
*   **AI-Powered Task Extension:** Any checklist item can be selected for further decomposition. The AI takes the context of the main goal and the specific item and generates more granular sub-tasks, which are then seamlessly inserted into the markdown.
*   **AI Chat Assistant:** A chat interface allows users to give natural language commands to modify the current task list (e.g., "Add a step for user authentication," "Rephrase the second item to be more formal"). The AI edits the markdown and returns the complete, updated file.
*   **Task Prioritization & Archiving:** Users can assign priorities (P1-P5) to tasks and archive/unarchive them. These actions are also saved as commits in the repository.
*   **Secure Settings Management:** Users configure their chosen Git provider (GitHub/GitLab), repository details, and Personal Access Token. Credentials are stored exclusively in the browser's `localStorage` and are never transmitted to any external servers except the chosen Git provider.

## 3. Architecture & Tech Stack

The application is a single-page application (SPA) that communicates with two main external services: the GitHub API and a serverless function that proxies requests to the Google Gemini API.

### Frontend

*   **Framework:** React `19` (with Hooks)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** TailwindCSS
*   **Markdown:** `react-markdown` with `remark-gfm` for GitHub-Flavored Markdown rendering.
*   **API Client:** Native `fetch` API for all HTTP requests.

### Backend / Services

*   **Multi-AI Provider Support:** Choose between Google Gemini or OpenRouter (400+ models including GPT, Claude, Llama) for all intelligent features.
*   **AI Proxy (`/api/ai`):** An Express.js backend that acts as a secure AI proxy.
    *   **Purpose:** It holds AI API keys as secure environment variables. The frontend never has access to these keys.
    *   **Functionality:** It receives requests from the frontend specifying an `action` (e.g., `generateInitialPlan`) and routes to the appropriate AI provider. It constructs system prompts, calls the AI API, and returns responses to the client.
*   **Git Provider Abstraction:** Unified backend support for multiple Git providers.
    *   **GitHub Integration:** Full API proxy at `/api/github` for GitHub.com operations
    *   **GitLab Integration:** Full API proxy at `/api/gitlab` for GitLab.com and self-hosted instances
    *   **Provider Router:** Frontend automatically routes to the correct backend based on user configuration
*   **Data Storage (Source of Truth):** User-controlled Git Repository on chosen provider.
    *   The application interacts with Git APIs through secure backend proxies for all file-based operations (reading, creating, updating, deleting files).

### Data Structure

*   **Local Storage:** Persists the user's Git provider settings (GitHub: `pat`, `owner`, `repo` or GitLab: `instanceUrl`, `projectId`, `token`, `branch`) in the browser.
*   **Git Repository (Provider-Agnostic):**
    *   Contains a configurable directory (default: `todos/`).
    *   Each task is a separate file, e.g., `todos/2025-01-15-deploy-web-app.md`.
    *   Files use **YAML Frontmatter** to store metadata.
    *   Compatible with any Git provider supporting file API operations.

#### Frontmatter Schema (`TodoFrontmatter`):

```yaml
---
title: 'Plan a weekend trip to the mountains'
createdAt: '2025-01-15T10:00:00.000Z'
priority: 3
isArchived: false
---
```

---

## 4. Workflows & Data Flow

### A) Creating a New Todo

1.  **User Input:** The user enters a goal (e.g., "Deploy the web app to production") in `NewTodoInput.tsx` and submits.
2.  **UI Update:** The `App.tsx` component adds a temporary "GENERATING" placeholder todo to the list and displays it to the user.
3.  **Generate Plan (AI Call):** `App.tsx` calls `generateInitialPlan()`, which POSTs to the `/api/gemini` proxy with `{ action: 'generateInitialPlan', payload: { goal } }`.
4.  **AI Proxy:** The serverless function receives the request, selects the `SYSTEM_PROMPT_INITIAL`, and calls the Gemini API.
5.  **Markdown Generation:** The Gemini API returns a markdown checklist. The proxy forwards this back to the client.
6.  **Prepare File:** The client now has the markdown content. It combines this with the default frontmatter.
7.  **Generate Commit Message (AI Call):** `App.tsx` calls `generateCommitMessage()`, which POSTs to the `/api/gemini` proxy with details about the new file. The AI returns a conventional commit message (e.g., `feat: Add task "Deploy web app to production"`).
8.  **GitHub API Call:** The `githubService.createOrUpdateTodo()` function is called. It makes a `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/todos/{filename}.md` request to the GitHub API, providing the Base64-encoded file content and the generated commit message.
9.  **Sync State:** After the GitHub API confirms the creation, `App.tsx` triggers a full re-fetch of all todos from the repository to ensure the local state is in sync with the source of truth.

### B) Checking a Box

1.  **User Action:** The user clicks a checkbox in the `MarkdownViewer.tsx` component.
2.  **Client-Side Markdown Update:** An `onChange` event handler identifies the line and toggles the `[ ]` to `[x]`, creating a new markdown string in memory.
3.  **Propagate Change:** The new markdown string is passed up to `App.tsx` via the `onMarkdownChange` prop.
4.  **Handle Mutation:** `App.tsx` triggers its `handleUpdateTodoContent` flow.
5.  **Generate Commit Message (AI Call):** As before, the client calls the proxy to generate a commit message. Given the small change, the AI is prompted to return something like `fix: Complete "Configure CI/CD pipeline"`.
6.  **GitHub API Call:** `githubService.createOrUpdateTodo()` is called again. This time, it includes the file's `sha` (a unique identifier for the file's current version), which is required by the GitHub API for updates.
7.  **Sync State:** The app re-fetches the todo list to get the updated file content and the new `sha`.

## 6. Security Considerations & Sovereign Architecture

*   **AI API Keys:** All AI provider keys (Gemini, OpenRouter) are stored securely as server-side environment variables. They are **never** exposed to the client, preventing unauthorized use.
*   **Git Provider Personal Access Tokens:**
    *   **Sovereign Storage:** All PATs are stored exclusively in the browser's `localStorage`, sandboxed to the application's origin and not accessible by other websites.
    *   **Direct Provider Communication:** The application only sends tokens directly to the chosen Git provider's domain over HTTPS (e.g., `api.github.com`, `gitlab.com`, or your self-hosted instance).
    *   **Fine-Grained Permissions:** Users are instructed to create tokens with minimal permissions restricted to only the specific repository used for the app.
    *   **Provider Freedom:** Switch between GitHub and GitLab at any time without vendor lock-in.
*   **Data Sovereignty:**
    *   **No Third-Party Data Storage:** Your task data never touches external services beyond your chosen Git provider.
    *   **Complete Portability:** Export, migrate, or clone your data at any time using standard Git operations.
    *   **Self-Hosting Support:** Deploy the entire application on your own infrastructure for complete control.
    *   **Zero Vendor Lock-in:** Your markdown files work with any Git provider and any markdown tool.
