# Agentic Markdown Todos - Project Concept

## Vision Statement

Agentic Markdown Todos transforms GitHub repositories into intelligent task management systems by merging the simplicity of plain text files with modern AI power. The core principle is **you own your data** - all tasks are stored as markdown files in your Git repository, editable with any tool.

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented Features

#### Core Application Architecture
- **React 19.1.0** frontend with TypeScript and responsive design
- **Express 5.1.0** backend with AI proxy and GitHub API integration
- **TailwindCSS 3.4.17** with mobile-first responsive layout
- **Two-panel layout** with sidebar task list and main content area

#### Task Management System
- **AI-powered task generation** from high-level goals to detailed checklists
- **Interactive markdown viewer** with clickable checkboxes and real-time GitHub sync
- **Full markdown editor** with edit/view mode toggle and unsaved changes protection
- **Priority system** (P1-P5) with color-coded visual indicators
- **Archive functionality** with bidirectional active ‚Üî archived task movement
- **Task deletion** with confirmation dialogs and progress tracking
- **Auto-directory setup** (creates `/todos` and `/todos/archive` folders automatically)

#### GitHub Integration
- **Smart file naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD-task-slug.md` format for human-readable files
- **YAML frontmatter** for metadata (title, priority, creation date, archive status, chat history)
- **Fine-grained Personal Access Token** security with repository-specific permissions
- **Conventional commits** with AI-generated semantic commit messages
- **Complete audit trail** with versioned Git history for all changes
- **Unicode support** with proper Base64 encoding for special characters

#### AI Integration
- **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** model for all intelligent features
- **Secure backend proxy** protects API keys from client exposure
- **AI chat assistant** integrated at bottom of each task for natural language modifications
- **Context-aware conversations** with persistent chat history in frontmatter
- **Intelligent task decomposition** from goals to actionable step-by-step plans
- **Automated commit message generation** following conventional commit standards

#### User Experience
- **Mobile-responsive design** with hamburger menu and touch-friendly interface
- **Progress tracking** with visual progress bars for all operations (create, save, delete)
- **Real-time updates** with immediate task list refresh and auto-selection
- **Error handling** with comprehensive debugging and user-friendly error messages
- **Loading states** with step-by-step feedback during AI processing and GitHub operations

### üîß Recent Critical Fixes (Current Session)

#### Archive Functionality Debugging
1. **Tab Count Issue**: Fixed incorrect tab counts showing 0 for archived tasks
   - **Root Cause**: Tab buttons were using already-filtered `todos` array instead of complete `allTodos` array
   - **Solution**: Updated App.tsx lines 661 and 671 to use `allTodos.filter()` for accurate counts

2. **Archive Sidebar Display Issue**: Fixed archived tasks not appearing in sidebar when archive tab selected
   - **Root Cause**: TodoSidebar component was filtering out archived tasks regardless of view mode
   - **Solution**: Removed duplicate `isArchived` filter in TodoSidebar.tsx line 62, letting App.tsx handle filtering

3. **Complete Archive Workflow**: Now fully functional end-to-end
   - Archive/unarchive operations work correctly
   - Task counts show accurate numbers in real-time
   - Sidebar displays appropriate tasks based on selected view mode
   - All operations properly sync with GitHub repository

### File Structure Pattern
```
your-repo/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todos/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-07-05-deploy-web-app.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-07-05-implement-auth.md

```

### Frontmatter Schema
```yaml
---
title: 'Deploy web application to production'
createdAt: '2025-07-05T10:00:00.000Z'
priority: 2
isArchived: false
chatHistory:
  - role: 'user'
    content: 'Add a step for database migration'
    timestamp: '2025-07-05T10:30:00.000Z'
  - role: 'assistant'
    content: 'I'll add a database migration step before the deployment.'
    timestamp: '2025-07-05T10:30:05.000Z'
---
```

## Development Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Full development setup
./restart.sh              # Restart both backend and frontend servers
cd server && node server.js  # Backend only (localhost:3001)
npm start                  # Frontend only (localhost:3000)
```

### Environment Configuration
- **Backend**: Requires `.env` file with `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- **Frontend**: GitHub settings stored in localStorage (PAT, repo owner, repo name)
- **Proxy**: Frontend automatically proxies `/api` requests to backend

## Security Considerations

### API Key Protection
- **Gemini API Key**: Stored securely as server-side environment variable, never exposed to client
- **GitHub PAT**: Stored in browser localStorage, sandboxed to application origin
- **Fine-grained permissions**: PAT restricted to specific repository only
- **HTTPS enforcement**: All API communications over secure connections

### Data Ownership
- **Git-based storage**: All data stored in user's own GitHub repository
- **No vendor lock-in**: Tasks are plain markdown files, readable by any tool
- **Complete portability**: Can migrate to any Git hosting service
- **Audit trail**: Full version history maintained through Git commits

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Planned Features
- **Collaborative workflows**: Multi-user task assignment and commenting
- **Integration ecosystem**: Slack, Discord, email notifications
- **Advanced AI features**: Automated task scheduling, deadline predictions
- **Deployment options**: Vercel Edge Functions, AWS Lambda, Docker containers
- **Enhanced mobile app**: Native iOS/Android applications
- **Bulk operations**: Multi-select, batch archive, priority updates

### Performance Optimizations
- **Caching layer**: Redis for frequently accessed tasks
- **Real-time sync**: WebSocket connections for live collaboration
- **Offline support**: Service worker for offline task management
- **Search functionality**: Full-text search across all tasks and chat history

## Current Deployment Status
